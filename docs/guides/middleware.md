# Corrected File Upload Middleware Documentation

## Updated file_upload.rs Documentation

### Function Documentation

````rust
/// Builtin File Upload Middleware
///
/// This middleware handles file uploads by processing request bodies and saving
/// them to a specified upload directory. It supports raw binary uploads and
/// multipart form data with automatic file type detection and unique filename generation.
///
/// ## Features
///
/// * **Automatic file extension detection** using the `infer` crate
/// * **Unique filename generation** with UUIDs to prevent conflicts
/// * **Graceful error handling** - continues request processing even if upload fails
/// * **Configurable upload directory** with fallback to "uploads"
/// * **Non-blocking operation** - doesn't short-circuit requests on upload failures
/// * **Supports multipart/form-data** - extracts ALL file parts and text fields
/// * **Multiple file support** - handles multiple files in a single request
///
/// ## Arguments
///
/// * `upload_dir` - Optional directory path for file uploads (defaults to "uploads")
///
/// ## How File Processing Works
///
/// The middleware processes requests as follows:
///
/// 1. **Content Detection**: Attempts to read the raw request body
/// 2. **Multipart Parsing**: If Content-Type is `multipart/form-data`, extracts all parts
/// 3. **Text Field Extraction**: Adds text fields to `req.form_data()`
/// 4. **File Processing**: Saves all file content with UUID filenames and detected extensions
/// 5. **Field Mapping**: Maps file input field names to generated UUID filenames in `req.form_data()`
/// 6. **Data Injection**: Sets comprehensive file information in request data
/// 7. **Error Handling**: Logs errors but continues request processing
///
/// ## Form Field Behavior
///
/// **For multipart forms:**
/// - **Text fields**: Available via `req.form_data()` with original names and values
/// - **File fields**: Field names are mapped to generated UUID filenames in `req.form_data()`
/// - **Example**: `<input name="profile_pic" type="file">` → `req.form_data().get("profile_pic")` returns UUID filename like `"a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890.jpg"`
///
/// **For single binary uploads:**
/// - Uses "file" as the default field name
/// - No original filename preservation
///
/// ## Request Data Available After Upload
///
/// **In req.get_data() (not form_data):**
/// - `uploaded_file_count` - Number of files successfully uploaded (as string)
/// - `uploaded_files` - JSON array of file information
/// - `uploaded_file` - First file's UUID filename (backwards compatibility)
/// - `uploaded_file_path` - First file's full path (backwards compatibility)
/// - `original_filename` - First file's original name if available from multipart
///
/// **In req.form_data():**
/// - Text field names → their string values
/// - File field names → their generated UUID filenames (strings)
///
/// ## Current Limitations
///
/// 1. **Original filename preservation**: Due to tuple handling in the code, original filenames
///    from multipart forms are not properly preserved in individual file processing
/// 2. **Single binary uploads**: Always use "file" as the field name, no original filename
/// 3. **Raw body access**: Requires successful `req.bytes()` call - may fail for some request types
/// 4. **Field mapping**: Only maps field names to UUID filenames; original filename info is not
///    available in form_data
///
/// ## Examples
///
/// Basic usage:
/// ```rust
/// use ripress::{app::App, middlewares::file_upload::file_upload};
/// let mut app = App::new();
/// app.use_middleware("/upload", file_upload(None));
/// ```
///
/// Custom upload directory:
/// ```rust
/// app.use_middleware("/upload", file_upload(Some("custom_uploads")));
/// ```
///
/// Processing uploaded files in a route handler:
/// ```rust
/// async fn upload_handler(req: HttpRequest, res: HttpResponse) -> HttpResponse {
///     // Check if files were uploaded
///     if let Some(count_str) = req.get_data("uploaded_file_count") {
///         let count: usize = count_str.parse().unwrap_or(0);
///
///         if count > 0 {
///             // Get detailed file information
///             if let Some(files_json) = req.get_data("uploaded_files") {
///                 res.ok().text(format!("Uploaded {} files: {}", count, files_json))
///             } else {
///                 // Access individual file info (backwards compatibility)
///                 let filename = req.get_data("uploaded_file").unwrap_or("unknown");
///                 let path = req.get_data("uploaded_file_path").unwrap_or("unknown");
///                 res.ok().text(format!("Uploaded file: {} at {}", filename, path))
///             }
///         } else {
///             res.ok().text("No files were uploaded")
///         }
///     } else {
///         res.ok().text("Upload processing not completed")
///     }
/// }
///
/// // Accessing form fields (including file field mappings)
/// async fn form_handler(req: HttpRequest, res: HttpResponse) -> HttpResponse {
///     // Get text fields
///     if let Some(username) = req.form_data().get("username") {
///         println!("Username: {}", username);
///     }
///
///     // Get file field mapping (returns UUID filename)
///     if let Some(avatar_filename) = req.form_data().get("avatar") {
///         println!("Avatar saved as: {}", avatar_filename);
///     }
///
///     res.ok().text("Form processed")
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Error Handling Philosophy
///
/// The middleware is designed to be non-blocking:
/// - **Upload failures**: Logged to stderr but don't stop request processing
/// - **Directory creation failures**: Logged but allow the request to continue
/// - **Body reading failures**: Logged but request continues normally
/// - **File write failures**: Logged per-file but don't short-circuit the request
/// - **Multipart parsing errors**: Gracefully fall back to single binary processing
///
/// ## Implementation Notes
///
/// - Processes `multipart/form-data` and raw binary content
/// - Creates upload directory automatically if it doesn't exist
/// - Uses `infer` crate for reliable file type detection
/// - Generates UUID v4 filenames to prevent conflicts
/// - Preserves all request data and continues processing chain
/// - Thread-safe and async-compatible design

## Updated mod.rs Documentation

````rust
/// File uploader middleware
///
/// This module provides middleware for handling file uploads in your application.
/// It processes binary request bodies and multipart form data, saving files to a
/// configurable upload directory with automatic extension detection and unique filename generation.
///
/// ## Key Features
///
/// * **Universal file processing** - Handles both raw binary and multipart form uploads
/// * **Smart content detection** - Automatically detects file types using binary analysis
/// * **Unique filenames** - Generates UUID-based names to prevent conflicts and overwrites
/// * **Form integration** - Maps file field names to generated filenames in form data
/// * **Text field extraction** - Processes all text fields from multipart forms
/// * **Non-blocking design** - Continues request processing even if uploads fail
/// * **Comprehensive logging** - Detailed error reporting for debugging
///
/// ## How It Works
///
/// 1. **Request Analysis**: Reads raw request body and detects content type
/// 2. **Multipart Processing**: If multipart/form-data, extracts all fields and files
/// 3. **File Detection**: Uses binary analysis to determine file extensions
/// 4. **Storage**: Saves files with UUID names in the configured directory
/// 5. **Data Mapping**: Updates request with file info and form field mappings
///
/// ## Data Available After Processing
///
/// **Request Data (via req.get_data()):**
/// - `uploaded_file_count` - Number of successfully uploaded files
/// - `uploaded_files` - JSON array with detailed file information
/// - `uploaded_file` - First file's UUID filename (compatibility)
/// - `uploaded_file_path` - First file's full path (compatibility)
/// - `original_filename` - Original name if available (multipart only)
///
/// **Form Data (via req.form_data()):**
/// - Text field names mapped to their values
/// - File field names mapped to their generated UUID filenames
///
/// ## Usage Example
///
/// ```rust
/// use ripress::{app::App, middlewares::file_upload::file_upload};
///
/// let mut app = App::new();
///
/// // Use default "uploads" directory
/// app.use_middleware("/upload", file_upload(None));
///
/// // Use custom directory
/// app.use_middleware("/files", file_upload(Some("user_files")));
///
/// // Route handler example
/// app.post("/upload", |req, res| async move {
///     match req.get_data("uploaded_file_count") {
///         Some(count) if count.parse::<usize>().unwrap_or(0) > 0 => {
///             // Files were uploaded successfully
///             let files_info = req.get_data("uploaded_files").unwrap_or("[]");
///             res.ok().json(&format!(r#"{{"status":"success","files":{}}}"#, files_info))
///         }
///         _ => {
///             // No files uploaded or upload failed
///             res.bad_request().text("No files received")
///         }
///     }
/// });
/// ```
///
/// ## Current Limitations
///
/// * **Original filename handling**: Due to internal tuple processing, original filenames
///   from multipart uploads may not be fully preserved in all contexts
/// * **Binary upload naming**: Single binary uploads always use "file" as the field name
/// * **Body access dependency**: Requires successful raw body reading, which may not work
///   for all request configurations
/// * **Error recovery**: While non-blocking, partial upload failures aren't individually reported
///
/// ## Technical Requirements
///
/// * Works with requests that have accessible binary body content
/// * Requires write permissions to the upload directory
/// * Uses `tokio` for async file operations
/// * Depends on `uuid` for unique filename generation
/// * Uses `infer` crate for file type detection
