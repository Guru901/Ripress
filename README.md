### An Express.js-inspired web framework for Rust

Please star the repo if you like it, so that I know someone is using it.

## What is Ripress?

Ripress is an Express.js-inspired web framework for Rust that combines the familiar developer experience of Express with the performance and safety of Rust. Built on top of [Hyper](https://hyper.rs) and [Tokio](https://tokio.rs), Ripress provides a simple and intuitive API for building fast, reliable web applications.

## Why Choose Ripress?

**ðŸš€ Performance**

- Ripress is just ~6â€“7% slower than Actix-Web (one of the fastest Rust web frameworks), even though performance hasnâ€™t been the main focus yet.
- Nearly 10x faster than Express.js

**ðŸ’¡ Developer Experience**

- Express.js-familiar API that Rust developers will love
- In many cases, even simpler than Express.js
- Comprehensive error handling and type safety

**âš¡ Modern Foundation**

- Async/await support with Tokio
- HTTP/2 support via Hyper

## Overview

Ripress is a web framework inspired by Express.js, designed to bring the familiar and intuitive Express.js developer experience to the Rust ecosystem while maintaining Rust's performance and safety guarantees.

## Features

- **Express-like routing** with `App` and `Router`
- **Async handler support** built on `tokio`
- **Pre and post middleware** for request/response processing
- **Built-in middleware** including CORS, logging, compression, and file uploads
- **Request/response objects** with JSON, text, and form parsing
- **Type-safe handler signatures** for better developer experience
- **WebSocket support** via the `wynd` crate (with "with-wynd" feature)
- **Extensible architecture** via custom middleware

## Goals

- Provide an intuitive and simple API like Express.js
- Focus on developer experience first; performance optimizations will come later
- Prioritize ease of use over low-level control initially
- Include built-in middleware for common web development needs

## Getting Started

The easiest way to get started is with the HexStack CLI.

HexStack is a project scaffolding tool (similar to create-t3-app) that lets you spin up new Rust web projects in seconds. With just a few selections, you can choose:

Backend: Ripress, Wynd, or both

Frontend: React, Svelte, or none

Extras: Out-of-the-box HTTP + WebSocket support

This means you can quickly bootstrap a full-stack project (Rust backend + modern frontend) or just a backend-only Ripress/Wynd project.

To create a new project with Ripress:

```sh
hexstack new my-project --template ripress
```

Alternatively, you can create a new project manually by running the following commands:

```sh
cargo new my-project
cd my-project
cargo add ripress
cargo add tokio --features macros,rt-multi-thread
```

This will create a new project with Ripress.

## Basic Example

```rust
use ripress::{
    app::App,
    context::{HttpRequest, HttpResponse},
    types::RouterFns,
};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let mut app = App::new();

    app.get("/", handler);

    app.listen(3000, || {
        println!("Server is running on port 3000");
    })
    .await;
}

async fn handler(_req: HttpRequest, res: HttpResponse) -> HttpResponse {
    res.status(200)
        .json(json!({"message": "Welcome to Ripress!"}))
}
```

### WebSocket Example

```rust
use ripress::{app::App, types::RouterFns};
use wynd::wynd::Wynd;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let mut app = App::new();
    let mut wynd = Wynd::new();

    // HTTP route
    app.get("/", |_, res| async move {
        res.ok().text("Hello, World!")
    });

    // WebSocket connection handler
    wynd.on_connection(|conn| async move {
        conn.on_text(|event, _| async move {
            println!("Received: {}", event.data);
        });
    });

    // Mount WebSocket at /ws path
    app.use_wynd("/ws", wynd.handler());

    app.listen(3000, || {
        println!("Server running on http://localhost:3000");
        println!("WebSocket available at ws://localhost:3000/ws");
    })
    .await;
}
```

## Middleware Example

```rust
use ripress::{
    app::App,
    middlewares::{file_upload::file_upload},
    types::RouterFns,
};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let mut app = App::new();

    // Add middleware (pre and post)
    app.use_cors(None)                                    // Pre-middleware
        .use_pre_middleware("/upload", file_upload(None)) // Pre-middleware
        .use_post_middleware("/api/", |req, res| async {  // Post-middleware
            println!("API response logged: {} {}", req.method, req.path);
            (req, None)
        })
        .use_rate_limiter(None);                          // Pre-middleware

    app.listen(3000, || {
        println!("Server running on port 3000");
    }).await;
}
```
